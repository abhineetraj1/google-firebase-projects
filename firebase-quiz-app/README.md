# Quiz app

This is firebase's Real-time Database and Cloud Functions can be used to build a quiz app that allows users to answer questions and get real-time feedback on their score.

## Installation
*	Create a new Firebase project at [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
*	In the Firebase console, click "Add app" and select "Web".
*	Enter a nickname for your app and click "Register app".
*	Copy the Firebase configuration object that appears on the screen.
*	Define the quiz questions and set up the quiz state in a JavaScript file.
*	Define the functions to display the quiz questions and handle user input in the same JavaScript file.
*	Initialize the Firebase app in the JavaScript file using the configuration object from step 4.
*	Save the user's score to the Firebase database using the Firebase Realtime Database API.

## Note
Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to run the quiz app in a web browser by opening the HTML file in your browser. Note that you will need to have Firebase Authentication set up and have the user authenticated in order to save the user's score to the Firebase database.
